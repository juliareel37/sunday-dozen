                <h2>How It Started</h2>
                <p>
                  I’ve loved baking ever since I was a little kid. I adored the
                  Food Network (especially Rachael Ray) and grew up trying to
                  recreate fun bakes I saw on Pinterest or in cookbooks. Not
                  only did I love baking, but I formed the hobby of trying every
                  new confection I could find. When I had to start eating
                  gluten-free a few years ago, I was truly devastated - I
                  thought I’d lost yummy baked goods forever. However, with some
                  recipe testing and lots of experimentation, I’ve discovered
                  how to make gluten-free truly taste like the classics.

                <h2>A Little Love in Every Box</h2>
                <p>
                  I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2023 with a
                  B.A. in Secondary Education. I fell in love with Ann Arbor and
                  have lived in the area ever since! My mom used to always send
                  a box of cookies to my college house during finals time. It
                  was so comforting to know I was being thought of (and to have
                  yummy cookies to help with my studying).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If I had been gluten-free during my time as a student this
                  would not have been possible. With risks of
                  cross-contamination and the overall lack of gluten-free
                  options, my mom would’ve had virtually zero options to send to
                  me. I am happy to say that I can fill that gap - allowing
                  parents to send a loving, delicious treat to their student
                  while they are away!

                <h2>The GF Cookie You've Been Waiting For</h2>
                <p>
                  Gluten-free cookies are often small, crumbly, and lack flavor.
                  Cookies from Sunday Dozen are the opposite. They have the
                  classic cookie texture we all crave - a crisp edge with a
                  soft, chewy center. Perfectly toasted brown butter gives the
                  base dough a complex, rich flavor that melts in your mouth.
                  Topped with flakey sea salt, they are the perfect treat.
