      "Hello, I’m Sophie! Sunday Dozen began in my home kitchen after I realized how hard it was to find gluten-free treats that truly taste just as good as the originals. After extensive recipe testing and experimenting, I found myself with a gluten-free cookie that was too good not to share.",
      "I bake in small batches using high-quality, gluten-free ingredients, and focus on rich flavors and bakery level quality. My kitchen is 100% free of gluten, making every cookie safe to consume for those with celiac disease. Each and every box is made with care, and I absolutely love being able to provide delicious, safe desserts for everyone to enjoy."
